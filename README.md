# TuringDemo
This is a simple web app that I created as an "art project" for my Computational Models class that simulates two Turing Machines. The web app allows a user to input a sting of 1s and 0s, and then it simulates the Turing Machines deciding whether the language accepts or rejects the given string. This project can be run at: http://nrs-projects.humboldt.edu/~jes1098/cs461/TuringDemo.php.
